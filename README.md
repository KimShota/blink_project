# Blink Project  

A research-focused repository for analyzing **eye-blink patterns** and their relationship to **mental fatigue, attention, and stress**. This project uses Python-based statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization methods to process large-scale blink datasets collected from VR-based experiments.  

The analyses here contribute to developing **objective fatigue assessment algorithms**, validated with **gaze/blink datasets from 1,000+ participants** in VR cognitive tasks.

## ðŸ”¬ Analysis Features  

This repository implements **multiple blink-related metrics**, including:  

- **Blink Duration Analysis** â€“ correlation with fatigue and attentional engagement.  
- **Blink Frequency Analysis** â€“ increased blinking under high fatigue states.  
- **Burst Counts Analysis** â€“ detection of blink flurries during fatigue.  
- **Inter-Blink Interval Analysis** â€“ changes in cognitive load and attention.  
- **Mismatch Analysis** â€“ irregular blink-timing events across tasks.  
- **Grid Counts per Blink** â€“ how gaze and blinks interact with visual exploration.  
- **Parametric & Box-Cox Analysis** â€“ ensuring statistical robustness and normality.  
- **Group Comparisons (High vs Low Fatigue)** â€“ statistical testing across participant groups.  
- **Stage-Based KMeans Clustering** â€“ unsupervised grouping of fatigue stages.  
- **Stress Score Plots** â€“ visualization of blink-derived fatigue/stress scores.

## ðŸ“Š Data & Workflow  

1. **Input Data**: CSV datasets (per participant) with blink timing, duration, and gaze context.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalization, log transformations, and outlier reduction.  
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Pearson, Spearman, Welchâ€™s t-test, ANOVA, Box-Cox.  
4. **Machine Learning**: KMeans clustering for fatigue stage categorization.  
5. **Visualization**: Group-by plots, stress score distributions, boxplots, and heatmaps.  
6. **Output**: Summaries in `summary/`, plots in `plots_stress_score/` and `Group_By_Analysis_Plots/`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Research Context  

This repository is part of a larger **VR-based fatigue research project**, which uses:  

- **VR experiments** (Flash Mental Arithmetic, focus tasks, distraction-based trials).  
- **Eye-tracking** (blink frequency, duration, bursts, mismatch).  
- **Large-scale datasets** (1,000+ participants).  
- **Goal**: Build a **practical brain fatigue scoring model** with predictive accuracy.  

Findings so far:  
- Higher blink frequency, bursts, and long inter-blink intervals correlate with **higher fatigue**.  
- Longer blink duration can reflect **fatigue in high-fatigue states**, but also **immersion/engagement in low-fatigue states**.  
- These nuanced patterns motivate building **adaptive fatigue algorithms**.
